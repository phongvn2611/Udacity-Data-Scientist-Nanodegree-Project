For this project I was interested in conducting exploratory data analysis using a [Wine Review dataset found on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews) containing approximately 130k reviews from the [Wine Enthusiast](https://www.winemag.com/?s=&drink_type=wine) to better understand:
 - Where does the best wine in the world come from? Is price related to quality?
 - What is the best wine in each price bracket?
 - What words are most used when talking about wine?
