# Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project

This repository contains my projects for Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree.

## Project 1: Write a Data Science Blog Post 
For this project I was interested in conducting exploratory data analysis using a Wine Review dataset found on Kaggle containing approximately 130k reviews from the Wine Enthusiast. I wanted the opportunity to explore the data and communicate my findings via a blog post on Medium which gives the reader insight into the questions posed.

## Project 2: Disaster Response Pipeline 
I applied my data engineering skills to analyze disaster data from [Figure Eight](https://appen.com/) to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages. I created a machine learning pipeline to categorize real messages that were sent during disaster events so that the messages could be sent to an appropriate disaster relief agency. The project includes a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app also displays visualizations of the data.

## Project 3: Recommendations with IBM
I analysed the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform and made recommendations to them about new articles I thought they'd like. I performed EDA, Rank Based Recommendations, User-user Based Collaborative Filtering, and Matrix factorisation.

## Project 4: Starbucks Challenge Capstone
I used some library of Python to analysis about Starbucks mobile app offers. The project involved:
- Loading and cleaning three datasets of Starbucks.
- Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis and answer some questions to understand datasets.
- Feature selection to select features that will be used in the modelling process.
- Modelling using machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
